# GitHub Flow 

![GitHub flow](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/topics/gitlab_flow.html#github-flow-as-a-simpler-alternative)

This project is being developed by following the [GiTHub flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow) , i.e. all new code is added in a separate branch and subsequently merged into the main branch. Production ready states are marked by tagging releases.
