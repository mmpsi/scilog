# Setup SciCat with Kubernetes

The procedure is described in the [localdeploy repository](https://github.com/SciCatProject/localdeploy)
It uses a minikube based Kubernetes system as the main deployment platform. It should run both on Linux and Mac Systems and is a convenient way to get a full "production like" system running on your laptop.
