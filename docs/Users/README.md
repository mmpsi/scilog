# User Manual

The User Manual summarizes the main functionality of the SciLog Web application by showing screenshot examples for all the parts of the application.

The guiding principle for the SciLog GUI is however, that it should be as self explaining as possible, such that no (costly) learning curve needs to be invested. This is mainly achieved by a sreamlined interface and the use of a WYSIWYG editor.

TODO: add screenshot with tooltips

For actions needing likely more explanations, in particular how to add snippet data automatically to the logbook, please have a look in the Ingestor manual.
