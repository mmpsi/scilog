# Contributing

There are 3 core ways to get involved with the SciLog project:

1. Documentation - Fixing errors, covering weaker areas, adding examples
2. Github Issues - This should be the first area to focus on for those that want to amend the code. 
3. Testing

For information about the development method we follow, please check [Development Methodology.](./Development_Methods.md)

## Issues

Issues are handled within the Github Issue tracker and should follow the template:

```markdown
## Issue Name

### Summary

### Steps to Reproduce

### Current Behaviour

### Expected Behaviour

### Extra Details

Here you should include details about the system (if it is unique) and possible information about a fix (feel free to link to code where relevant). Screenshots/GIFs are also fine here.
